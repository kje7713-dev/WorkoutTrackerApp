# WorkoutTrackerApp (Savage By Design)

An iOS workout tracking application built with SwiftUI for structured training through block periodization.

## Overview

WorkoutTrackerApp helps athletes, coaches, and fitness enthusiasts create, manage, and track strength training and conditioning workouts through a structured block periodization model.

### Key Features

- **Training Block Management**: Create multi-week training blocks with progressive overload
- **Exercise Library**: Comprehensive exercise database with categorization
- **Workout Session Tracking**: Real-time logging with sets, reps, weight, and conditioning metrics
- **AI-Assisted Block Generation**: Draft model for automated program design
- **Superset & Circuit Support**: Complex training structure support
- **Block History**: Track completed workouts and review past performance
- **Conditioning Workouts**: Support for time, distance, and calorie-based cardio

## Tech Stack

- **Platform**: iOS 17.0+
- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository pattern
- **Project Generation**: XcodeGen
- **Build Automation**: Fastlane
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Codemagic

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 16.0 or later
- Ruby 3.2 or later
- Homebrew (for installing dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kje7713-dev/WorkoutTrackerApp.git
cd WorkoutTrackerApp
```

2. Install XcodeGen:
```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

3. Install Ruby dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```

4. Generate the Xcode project:
```bash
xcodegen generate
```

5. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open WorkoutTrackerApp.xcodeproj
```

### Building for Development

1. Select your target device or simulator in Xcode
2. Build and run: `⌘R`

### Building for Release

Using Fastlane:
```bash
bundle exec fastlane beta
```

This will:
- Generate the Xcode project
- Build the app in Release configuration
- Upload to TestFlight

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

For CI/CD builds, configure the following secrets in GitHub:

- `ASC_KEY_ID`: App Store Connect API Key ID
- `ASC_ISSUER_ID`: App Store Connect Issuer ID
- `ASC_KEY`: App Store Connect API Key (base64 encoded)
- `APPLE_ID`: Apple Developer Account Email
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Apple Team ID
- `APP_IDENTIFIER`: App Bundle ID (com.kje7713.WorkoutTrackerApp)
- `MATCH_GIT_URL`: Git repository URL for code signing certificates
- `MATCH_GIT_TOKEN`: GitHub token for certificate repository access
- `MATCH_PASSWORD`: Password for encrypting certificates
- `IOS_SCHEME`: Xcode scheme name (WorkoutTrackerApp)

### Version Management

Version numbers are configured in `project.yml`:
- `MARKETING_VERSION`: User-facing version (e.g., "1.0")
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`: Build number (auto-incremented by CI)

Build numbers use timestamp format (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`) to ensure uniqueness.

## Testing

Run tests in Xcode: `⌘U`

Test files are located in the `Tests/` directory and follow the naming pattern `*Tests.swift`.

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Views → Repositories → FileManager (JSON persistence)
  ↓
EnvironmentObjects (Shared State)
```

### Repository Pattern

Three main repositories handle data:
- `BlocksRepository`: Training blocks and templates
- `SessionsRepository`: Live workout sessions
- `ExerciseLibraryRepository`: Exercise definitions

### Models

- **Template Models**: Used for planning (Block, DayTemplate, ExerciseTemplate)
- **Session Models**: Used for tracking (WorkoutSession, SessionSet)
- **Progression**: Week-based progression applied when creating sessions
