## Understanding Training Blocks

### What is a Training Block?

A **training block** is a structured workout program that spans multiple weeks. Think of it as a complete training cycle designed to help you achieve specific fitness goals.

**Key Components:**
- **Block Name** – What you call your program (e.g., "Summer Strength Program")
- **Number of Weeks** – How long the block runs (typically 4-12 weeks)
- **Days** – Individual workout days that repeat each week
- **Exercises** – The specific movements you'll perform

### Block Periodization

The app uses **block periodization**, a proven training method where:
- You plan workouts in advance
- Exercises progress week-over-week (progressive overload)
- You can program deload weeks for recovery
- Each week builds on the previous one

**Example Block Structure:**
```
Block: "Spring Strength Cycle"
├── Week 1-3: Build phase
├── Week 4: Deload
└── Weeks 5-6: Peak phase

Days per week:
├── Day 1: Upper Body Push
├── Day 2: Lower Body
├── Day 3: Upper Body Pull
└── Day 4: Conditioning
```

### Training Goals

Blocks can target different goals:
- **Strength** – Build maximum force production
- **Hypertrophy** – Muscle size and growth
- **Power** – Explosive strength
- **Conditioning** – Cardiovascular fitness
- **Mixed** – Combination of goals
- **Peaking** – Preparing for competition
- **Deload** – Recovery and adaptation
- **Rehab** – Injury recovery

## Understanding Segments

### What are Segments?

**Segments** are an alternative way to structure training days, designed for activities that don't fit the traditional sets/reps/weight model. While exercises focus on strength and conditioning with quantifiable metrics, segments represent distinct phases or modules within a training session.

**Key Differences:**

| **Exercises** | **Segments** |
|---------------|--------------|
| Sets, reps, weight | Time-based modules |
| Strength & conditioning focused | Skill-based activities |
| Progressive overload via weight/volume | Progressive via complexity/resistance |
| Examples: Squats, bench press | Examples: Technique work, sparring rounds |

### When to Use Segments vs. Exercises

**Use Exercises for:**
- Weightlifting and strength training
- Conditioning with measurable outputs (distance, calories, time)
- Activities with clear set/rep structures
- Progressive overload through weight or volume

**Use Segments for:**
- Martial arts training (BJJ, wrestling, judo, MMA)
- Yoga and mobility work
- Skill-based practice sessions
- Class-style training with distinct phases
- Activities focused on technique over load

**Hybrid Approach:**
You can mix both in a single day! For example:
- Strength training (exercises) followed by mobility work (segments)
- BJJ class (segments) with conditioning finisher (exercises)

            "rounds": 3,
            "roundDurationSeconds": 180,
            "restSeconds": 60,
            "resistance": 30
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Method 2: Using AI Block Generator (Pro Feature)

1. From **BLOCKS** screen, tap **AI BLOCK GENERATOR**
2. Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate segment-based blocks
3. Prompt example: 
   ```
   "Create a 4-week BJJ training block in JSON format with segments 
   for warmup, technique, drilling, and live training. Focus on 
   guard passing concepts."
   ```
4. Import the generated JSON file or paste directly

### Method 3: Hybrid Days (Exercises + Segments)

You can combine traditional exercises with segments in the same day:

**Use Cases:**
- Strength work followed by mobility (exercises → segments)
- Wrestling technique followed by conditioning (segments → exercises)
- Lifting with yoga cooldown (exercises → segments)

**In JSON:**
```json
{
  "name": "Hybrid Day",
  "exercises": [
    {
      "name": "Back Squat",
      "sets": 4,
      "reps": 5,
      "weight": 225
    }
  ],
  "segments": [
    {
      "name": "Hip Mobility",
      "segmentType": "mobility",
      "durationMinutes": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tips for Creating Segment-Based Blocks

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with basic segments (warmup, technique, cooldown)
   - Add complexity as needed
   - Not every field needs to be populated

2. **Be Clear with Objectives**
   - Each segment should have a clear learning goal
   - Help athletes understand the "why"

3. **Use Appropriate Segment Types**
   - Match segment type to the activity
   - Use "other" for anything that doesn't fit

4. **Plan Realistic Durations**
   - Account for transitions between segments
   - Leave buffer time for instruction

5. **Include Safety Notes**
   - Especially important for high-intensity or contact segments
   - Document contraindications and stop conditions

6. **Track What Matters**
   - Use quality targets for skill-based work
   - Don't worry about tracking every metric
   - Focus on meaningful progression

7. **Consider Hybrid Approaches**
   - Mix exercises and segments when appropriate
   - Use the right tool for each activity

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Beginners

1. **Start Simple**
   - Create a 4-week block with 3 days per week
   - Focus on basic compound exercises
   - Use 3-4 sets of 5-8 reps for strength

2. **Learn the Interface**
   - Run through a test workout to understand logging
   - Explore the Whiteboard view
   - Practice saving and editing blocks

3. **Be Consistent**
   - Stick to your schedule
   - Log every set, even if you don't hit targets
   - Review your history weekly

### For Advanced Users

1. **Progressive Overload**
   - Use the Delta Weight/Sets features
   - Plan deload weeks (week 4, 8, 12)
   - Track RPE/RIR for intensity management

2. **Block Programming**
   - Create specialized blocks (strength, hypertrophy, peaking)
   - Use week templates for varied programming
   - Clone successful blocks and adjust for next cycle

3. **Superset & Circuits**
   - Group exercises by assigning Set Group IDs (in advanced mode)
   - Plan rest periods strategically
   - Use conditioning blocks for metabolic work

### General Tips

✅ **DO:**
- Log every workout, even if incomplete
- Review previous weeks before planning the next block
- Use notes fields for coaching cues
- Export data backups monthly
- Screenshot your whiteboard for quick reference
- Use segments for skill-based training (BJJ, yoga, martial arts)
- **Use segments for learning activities** (AI/tech classes, language learning, music practice)
- **Use segments for professional development** (public speaking, skill workshops)
- **Use segments for study sessions** (structured academic work, research time)
- Mix exercises and segments when appropriate (hybrid days)
- Track quality over quantity for segment-based work
- Adapt segment types creatively (e.g., "Drill" for coding exercises, "Technique" for learning concepts)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip logging—you lose valuable data
- Delete blocks immediately after completion (archive first)
- Forget to progress weight/volume across weeks
- Ignore deload weeks—recovery is training
- Use exercises for activities better suited to segments (e.g., yoga, BJJ classes, learning sessions)
- Force non-quantifiable activities into sets/reps/weight structure
