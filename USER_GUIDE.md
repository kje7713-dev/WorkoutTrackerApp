## Understanding Training Blocks

### What is a Training Block?

A **training block** is a structured workout program that spans multiple weeks. Think of it as a complete training cycle designed to help you achieve specific fitness goals.

**Key Components:**
- **Block Name** – What you call your program (e.g., "Summer Strength Program")
- **Number of Weeks** – How long the block runs (typically 4-12 weeks)
- **Days** – Individual workout days that repeat each week
- **Exercises** – The specific movements you'll perform

### Block Periodization

The app uses **block periodization**, a proven training method where:
- You plan workouts in advance
- Exercises progress week-over-week (progressive overload)
- You can program deload weeks for recovery
- Each week builds on the previous one

**Example Block Structure:**
```
Block: "Spring Strength Cycle"
├── Week 1-3: Build phase
├── Week 4: Deload
└── Weeks 5-6: Peak phase

Days per week:
├── Day 1: Upper Body Push
├── Day 2: Lower Body
├── Day 3: Upper Body Pull
└── Day 4: Conditioning
```

### Training Goals

Blocks can target different goals:
- **Strength** – Build maximum force production
- **Hypertrophy** – Muscle size and growth
- **Power** – Explosive strength
- **Conditioning** – Cardiovascular fitness
- **Mixed** – Combination of goals
- **Peaking** – Preparing for competition
- **Deload** – Recovery and adaptation
- **Rehab** – Injury recovery

---

## Creating Your First Block

### Step 1: Access Block Builder

2. Tap **CREATE NEW BLOCK** at the bottom
3. You'll enter the Block Builder interface

- **Progression Type** – How exercises will progress:
  - **Weight** – Add weight each week
  - **Volume** – Add sets/reps each week
  - **Custom** – Manual progression

**Progression Settings:**
- **Delta Weight** – How much weight to add per week (e.g., 5 lbs)
- **Delta Sets** – How many additional sets per week (e.g., 1 set)

### Step 3: Create Day Templates

Each block contains **day templates** that define your workouts:

1. **Select a Day Tab** at the top (Day 1, Day 2, etc.)
2. **Name Your Day** – E.g., "Upper Body Push", "Legs", "Conditioning"
3. **Add Exercises** by tapping the **+ ADD EXERCISE** button

- **Type** – Strength or Conditioning
- **Notes** (optional) – Coaching cues or reminders

**For Strength Exercises:**
- **Number of Sets** – How many sets (e.g., 4)
- **Reps** – Repetitions per set (e.g., 6)

- **RPE** (Rating of Perceived Exertion) – Scale of 1-10
- **RIR** (Reps in Reserve) – How many reps left in the tank
- **Tempo** – Movement speed (e.g., "3-1-1-0")
- **Rest** – Seconds between sets (e.g., 180)

**For Conditioning Exercises:**
- **Duration** – Time in seconds
- **Distance** – Meters or miles
- **Rounds** – Number of rounds to complete
- **Calories** – Target calorie burn
- **Target Pace** – Desired pace (e.g., "2:00/500m")
- **Effort Descriptor** – Intensity level (e.g., "Easy", "Moderate", "Hard")
- **Rest** – Recovery time between intervals

### Step 5: Save Your Block

1. Review all days and exercises
2. Tap **SAVE** in the top-right corner

## AI Block Generation

### What is AI Block Generation? (Pro Feature)

The app can **import training blocks from JSON files** that are generated by AI or other tools. This allows coaches, programmers, or AI assistants to create structured blocks that you can import directly.

### How to Use AI Block Generator

1. From **BLOCKS** screen, tap **AI BLOCK GENERATOR**
2. You have two options:
   - **Import from File** – Select a `.json` file from your device
   - **Paste JSON** – Copy and paste JSON directly into the app

### JSON Format Requirements

The JSON must follow the Block structure:
- Block name, description, number of weeks
- Day templates with exercises
- Exercise details (sets, reps, progression)
- Strength or conditioning parameters

**Example Use Cases:**
- Import programs from online coaches
- Use ChatGPT or other AI to generate training blocks
- Share blocks between devices via JSON files
- Backup and transfer blocks

**Note:** This feature is for **importing** blocks only. The app doesn't generate AI content itself—it imports blocks created externally.

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Beginners

1. **Start Simple**
   - Create a 4-week block with 3 days per week
   - Focus on basic compound exercises
   - Use 3-4 sets of 5-8 reps for strength

2. **Learn the Interface**
   - Run through a test workout to understand logging
   - Explore the Whiteboard view
   - Practice saving and editing blocks

3. **Be Consistent**
   - Stick to your schedule
   - Log every set, even if you don't hit targets
   - Review your history weekly

### For Advanced Users

1. **Progressive Overload**
   - Use the Delta Weight/Sets features
   - Plan deload weeks (week 4, 8, 12)
   - Track RPE/RIR for intensity management

2. **Block Programming**
   - Create specialized blocks (strength, hypertrophy, peaking)
   - Use week templates for varied programming
   - Clone successful blocks and adjust for next cycle

3. **Superset & Circuits**
   - Group exercises by assigning Set Group IDs (in advanced mode)
   - Plan rest periods strategically
   - Use conditioning blocks for metabolic work

### General Tips

✅ **DO:**
- Log every workout, even if incomplete
- Review previous weeks before planning the next block
- Use notes fields for coaching cues
- Export data backups monthly
- Screenshot your whiteboard for quick reference

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip logging—you lose valuable data
- Delete blocks immediately after completion (archive first)
- Forget to progress weight/volume across weeks
- Ignore deload weeks—recovery is training

### Sample Programs to Try

**Beginner Strength (4 weeks, 3 days/week):**
- Day 1: Squat, Bench, Rows
- Day 2: Deadlift, Overhead Press, Pull-ups
- Day 3: Conditioning + Accessories

**Intermediate Hypertrophy (6 weeks, 4 days/week):**
- Day 1: Upper Push (8-12 reps)
- Day 2: Lower (8-12 reps)
- Day 3: Upper Pull (8-12 reps)
- Day 4: Full Body or Conditioning

**Advanced Strength (12 weeks, 5 days/week):**
- Linear periodization from 5x5 to 3x3 to 1x1
- Deloads on weeks 4, 8, 12
- Accessory work at 3x10-15

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: My workout isn't saving**
- Check that you tapped the checkmark to complete sets
- Ensure you have storage space on your device
- Try closing and reopening the session
- The app auto-saves—your data should be there

**Q: I can't see my completed block**
- Check **BLOCK HISTORY** (not BLOCKS)
- Archived blocks move automatically after completion
- Use the search function if you have many blocks

**Q: Progression isn't working**
- Verify Delta Weight/Sets in block settings
- Check that progression type is set correctly
- Some exercises may need manual adjustment

**Q: I lost my data**
- Data is stored locally—if you deleted the app, it's gone
- Restore from a backup if you exported data
- In the future, export backups regularly

**Q: Whiteboard/AI Generator says "Pro Only"**
- These are subscription features
- Tap **GO PRO** to unlock
- Free trial may be available

**Q: Exercise won't save**
- Make sure name field isn't empty
- Check that sets/reps have valid numbers
- Type must be either Strength or Conditioning
